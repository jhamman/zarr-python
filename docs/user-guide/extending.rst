Extending Zarr
==============

Zarr-Python 3 was designed to be extensible. This means that you can extend
the library by writing custom classes and plugins. Currently, Zarr can be extended
in the following ways:

1. Writing custom stores
2. Writing custom codecs

In the future, Zarr will support writing custom custom data types and chunk grids.
